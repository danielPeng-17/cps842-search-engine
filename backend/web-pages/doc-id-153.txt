 * IMPLEMENTING FORM FILLING AND ACCESSIBILITY IN THE FIREFOX PDF VIEWER
   [https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/10/implementing-form-filling-and-accessibility-in-the-firefox-pdf-viewer/]
   
   Last year, during lockdown, many discovered the importance of PDF forms when having to deal remotely with administrations and large organizations
   like banks. Firefox supported displaying PDF forms, but it didn‚Äôt support filling them: users had to print them, fill them by hand, and scan them
   back to digital form. We decided it was time to reinvest in the PDF viewer (PDF.js) and support filling PDF forms within Firefox to make our users'
   lives easier.The post Implementing form filling and accessibility in the Firefox PDF viewer appeared first on Mozilla Hacks - the Web developer
   blog.

   In a world where data and AI are reshaping society, people currently have no tangible way to put their data to work for the causes they believe in.
   To address this, we built the Rally platform, a first-of-its-kind tool that enables you to contribute your data to specific studies and exercise
   consent at a granular level. Mozilla Rally puts you in control of your data while building a better Internet and a better society.¬†The post Control
