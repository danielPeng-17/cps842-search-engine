SPFMILTER - SPF MAIL FILTER MODULE

Fetch the software. [spfmilter-2.001.tar.gz] Release notes.

A note on version numbers. There is another site which distributes spfmilter packages with 1.0.x versions numbers. The 1.0.x series are unauthorized
copies of old versions from here. Their version numbers were changed for political reasons, not engineering reasons. Those versions should be ignored.

Because of this issue, there has never been a legitimate 1.x version of spfmilter. The legitimate versions went from 0.99 straight to 2.0.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sendmail includes a facility for plugging in custom mail filters, called milters. It's documented here [https://www.milter.org/developers/api/].
Spfmilter implements the Sender Policy Framework (SPF [http://www.openspf.org/]) as a milter, using either the libspf
[http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libspf.html] or libspf2 [http://www.libspf2.org/] libraries.

The idea of SPF is to prevent email forgery. Each participating site sets up a little definition of which hosts are allowed to send mail claiming to
be from that site. When another site receives mail, it checks the permitted-senders definition for the originating site. If the check fails, the mail
is rejected.

Setting up the permitted-senders definition is very easy, you go to the SPF Wizard [http://spf.pobox.com/wizard.html] and fill out a little form, then
put the resulting string into your DNS records. This milter implements the second half of SPF, checking the mail you receive against other sites' SPF
records.

RELEASE NOTES

Version 2.001, 25feb2015:

 * IPv6 portability fix.
 * Avoid SEGV with --localpolicy under libspf2.

Version 2.0, 12feb2015:

 * Updated to the current milter API.
 * Updated to the current libspf and libspf2.
 * Updated the FreeBSD rc.conf script to modern standards.
 * Replaced the whitelist data structure with one that handles IPv6.

Version 0.99, 14aug2014:

 * Some more cleanup.

Version 0.98, 16jul2014:

 * Changed the regular SMTP response code used in -graylist mode from 451 to 421. (Jobst Schmalenbach)
 * Added pidfile option.
 * Updated for clang, and general cleanup.

Version 0.97, 20jun2005:

 * Some improvements to the redhat rcscripts. (Paul Howarth)
 * Deal with the unknown-family connections which occasionally show up on some OSs, such as Solaris. (Joel Lord)

Version 0.96, 26apr2005:

 * Use smfi_insheader() if it's available, so that the Received-SPF header goes at the front where the spec says it belongs.

Version 0.95, 26sep2004:

 * Fixed problem with guess/fallback mode when using libspf.

Version 0.94, 10sep2004:

 * Clean up memory from the iparray module, so that valgrind doesn't complain.
 * If fetching the {j} macro from sendmail doesn't give us the local hostname, call gethostname().
 * Avoid potential memory leak from multiple HELOs in the same connection.
 * Avoid potential SEGV from no HELO.
 * If the envelope-from address is empty or doesn't have an @, make a fake one using the HELO domain.
 * Trim CRs off the ends of addresses.
 * Added ifdef to optionally not use libspf2's caching DNS layer.
 * Added autoconf stuff.

Version 0.93, 07aug2004:

 * Moved the larger local string buffers to the connection-data object, so the threads don't use so much stack space.

Version 0.92, 05aug2004:

 * Minor tweak so my spfmilter.c works with Shevek's autoconf setup.

Version 0.91, 05aug2004:

 * Match fallback patterns against only the hostname part of from-addresses, not the whole address. (Paul Howarth)
 * Only delete SPF headers that claim to be from the local hostname. (Paul Howarth)
 * Added an rc_scripts directory.
 * Fixed memory leak. (Ken Serrine)

Version 0.90, 30jul2004:

 * Accept authenticated messages without doing the SPF check. (Ivan Martinez, Mike Markley)
 * Better version of --recipientmx check. (Paul Howarth)
 * First version of code to work with libspf as well as libspf2. To use with libspf, edit the Makefile and switch the commenting on the first four
   lines. This code runs but has not been tested for more than a few minutes.

Version 0.86, 15jul2004:

 * Fixed a bug that only showed up when the resolver pool had to be expanded to deal with more than 100 threads.

Version 0.85, 15jul2004:

 * Changed the behavior on DNS errors. Previously, the message triggering the error was returned with a temporary failure code. If the DNS error
   persisted, then eventually the message would time out and bounce. As of this version, such messages are accepted and marked with a Received-SPF
   header, which should contain an explanation of the error.

Version 0.80, 11jul2004:

 * Added IP whitelisting.
 * Added wildcard fallback records.

Version 0.50, 19jun2004:

 * Packaging help from Shevek.
 * Worked around a memory leak in the resolver library by adding a persistent pool of resolver objects.

Version 0.10, 31may2004:

 * First version.

INSTALLATION

This is very abbreviated, intended mainly as a reminder for those who have worked with milters before. If it's your first milter, you should look on
the web for more thorough documentation. Also, these instructions are pretty specific to FreeBSD, and will have to be adapted for other OSs.

 1. Make sure your sendmail is compiled with the MILTER option. (Starting with version 8.13 this is enabled by default.) You can use this command to
    check:
    
    > sendmail -d0.1 -bt < /dev/null | grep MILTER
    >         
    
    If you don't see MILTER in the compilation options, you will have to re-build sendmail.
 2. Fetch, build, and install either libspf [http://www.libspf.org/] or libspf2 [http://www.libspf2.org/]. If you use libspf be sure to configure with
    the "--enable-pthreads" option.
 3. Build and install the spfmilter executable, by doing a './configure ; make ; make install'.
 4. Edit your sendmail.mc and add a mail filter macro, for example:
    
    > INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`spfmilter',`S=unix:/var/run/spfmilter.sock')
    >         
    
    Rebuild and install sendmail.cf.
 5. Run spfmilter, with the same socket argument you used in sendmail.mc:
    
    > # spfmilter unix:/var/run/spfmilter.sock
    >         

 6. Stop and re-start sendmail.
 7. Look in /var/log/maillog for messages from spfmilter.
 8. When you've verified that it's working, add lines to your /etc/rc.conf so it starts up at boot time:
    
    > spfmilter_enable="YES"
    > spfmilter_socket="unix:/var/run/spfmilter.sock"
    >

OTHER SPF MILTERS

 * SPF milter in Perl [http://spf.pobox.com/sendmail-milter-spf-1.41.pl].
 * Generic milter in Python [http://www.bmsi.com/python/milter.html] that can do SPF checking.
 * spamilter [http://www.wanlink.com/spamilter/], a general anti-spam milter in C that includes SPF checking.
