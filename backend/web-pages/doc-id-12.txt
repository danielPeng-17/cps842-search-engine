LINE MODE BROWSER

One of several browsers of the WWW project [../TheProject.html] . The LineMode Browser is suitable for use on dumb terminals, requiring no control
sequences except for carriage return and line feed. It is also of course useable from terminal emulators in workstation windows. It can also be used
as a text formatter, as part of a mail server, and as a general information retrieval tool. See :
