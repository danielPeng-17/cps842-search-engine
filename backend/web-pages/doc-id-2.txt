What is Hypertext?


WHAT IS HYPERTEXT

Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.

Hypertext is text which contains links [Terms.html#link] to other texts. The term was coined by Ted Nelson [Xanadu.html#Nelson] around 1965 (see
History [../History.html] ).

HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and sound [Talks/YesWeCan.snd] , for
example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.

Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.
