Steve Dolby [https://draft.blogger.com/profile/01378393064356544683] Steven Dolby was born in Rotherham, England 1974. Even from a young age Steven
enjoyed artistic pursuits like creating original artwork and music. However he lacked even a basic knowledge of food and cooking techniques until he
was 21 years old. At this stage his passion for all things culinary was ignited as he began to train with chefs in restaurants first in England, then
around Europe. Steven has since moved to the united states and began to explore the cuisine of the Americas. His mentor won his first Michelin star in
2012 he currently lives in Atlanta, GA with his wife. Steve Dolby has been cooking professionally in restaurants for 17 years. Visit profile
