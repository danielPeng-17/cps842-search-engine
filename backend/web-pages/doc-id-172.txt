HTTP

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Layer] protocol for transmitting hypermedia
documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP
follows a classical client-server model [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model], with a client opening a connection to make a
request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol], meaning that the
server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.


TUTORIALS

Learn how to use HTTP with guides and tutorials.

Overview of HTTP [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview]

The basic features of the client-server protocol: what it can do and its intended uses.

HTTP Cache [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching]

Caching is very important for fast Web sites. This article describes different methods of caching and how to use HTTP Headers to control them.

HTTP Cookies [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies]

How cookies work is defined by RFC 6265 [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265]. When serving an HTTP request, a server can send a Set-Cookie
HTTP header with the response. The client then returns the cookie's value with every request to the same server in the form of a Cookie request
header. The cookie can also be set to expire on a certain date, or restricted to a specific domain and path.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS]

Cross-site HTTP requests are HTTP requests for resources from a different domain than the domain of the resource making the request. For instance, an
HTML page from Domain A (http://domaina.example/) makes a request for an image on Domain B (http://domainb.foo/image.jpg) via the img element. Web
pages today very commonly load cross-site resources, including CSS stylesheets, images, scripts, and other resources. CORS allows web developers to
control how their site reacts to cross-site requests.

Evolution of HTTP [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Evolution_of_HTTP]

A brief description of the changes between the early versions of HTTP, to the modern HTTP/2, the emergent HTTP/3 and beyond.

Mozilla web security guidelines [https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Guidelines/Web_Security]

A collection of tips to help operational teams with creating secure web applications.

HTTP Messages [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages]

Describes the type and structure of the different kind of messages of HTTP/1.x and HTTP/2.

A typical HTTP session [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Session]

Shows and explains the flow of a usual HTTP session.

Connection management in HTTP/1.x [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Connection_management_in_HTTP_1.x]

Describes the three connection management models available in HTTP/1.x, their strengths, and their weaknesses.


REFERENCE

Browse through detailed HTTP reference documentation.

HTTP Headers [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers]

HTTP message headers are used to describe a resource, or the behavior of the server or the client. Header fields are kept in an IANA registry
[https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml#perm-headers]. IANA also maintains a registry of proposed new HTTP message
headers [https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml#prov-headers].

HTTP Request Methods [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods]

The different operations that can be done with HTTP: GET [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/GET], POST [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST], and also less
common requests like OPTIONS [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/OPTIONS], DELETE [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/DELETE], or TRACE
[/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/TRACE].

HTTP Status Response Codes [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status]

HTTP response codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes: informational
responses, successful responses, redirections, client errors, and servers errors.

CSP directives [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy]

The Content-Security-Policy [/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy] response header fields allows web site administrators to control
resources the user agent is allowed to load for a given page. With a few exceptions, policies mostly involve specifying server origins and script
endpoints.
