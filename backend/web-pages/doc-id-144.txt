WHAT DOES ACME MEAN?

We get this question a lot, here at ACME Labs.

 * The dictionary definition is: "the top", or "the highest point", or just "perfection". This is straight from Greek. (Greek mythology also includes
   a nymph named Acme [acme_nymph.html].)
 * Apparently some early business school textbooks liked to use Acme as a business name in some of their examples.
 * There's a story that the business school use is an acronym, standing for "A Company Manufacturing Everything". This is probably false etymology.
 * Sears-Roebuck used Acme as one of their in-house brand names in the early 1900s, just like they use "Craftsman" today. For instance, take a look at
   this ad for an Acme anvil [/calendar/images/anvil_ad.gif] from the 1902 Sears catalog.
 * Warner Brothers apparently took the name from Sears and used it for the mail-order company in the Wile E. Coyote
   [/calendar/images/coyote-harpoon.jpg] cartoons.
