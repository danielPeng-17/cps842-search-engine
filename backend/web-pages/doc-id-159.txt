GRAPHICS ON THE WEB

Websites and applications often need to present graphics, such as images. Static images can easily be displayed using the <img>
[/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img] element, or by setting the background of HTML elements using the background-image
[/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image] property. You can also construct graphics on-the-fly, or manipulate images after the fact. These articles
provide insight into how you can accomplish this.


2D GRAPHICS

Canvas [/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API]

The <canvas> [/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/canvas] element provides APIs to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript.

SVG [/en-US/docs/Web/SVG]

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) lets you use lines, curves, and other geometric shapes to render graphics. With vectors, you can create images that
scale cleanly to any size.


3D GRAPHICS

WebGL [/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API]

A guide to getting started with WebGL, the 3D graphics API for the Web. This technology lets you use standard OpenGL ES in web content.


VIDEO

Using HTML5 audio and video [/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content]

(peers).
