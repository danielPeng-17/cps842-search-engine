W3 TOOLS

These tools aid managements of W3 servers, generation of hypertext, etc. W3 basic daemon [../Daemon/Basic.html] Part of the W3 project code. Gateway
servers [../Daemon/Overview.html#17] which you can take and adapt. Framemaker interface [../Frame/fminit2.0/www_and_frame.html] There are some tar
files on the anonymous FTP archive on file://info.cern.ch/www/src which allow FRAMEmaker to be used as a W3 tool. Dan Conolly, Convex. Incldues MIF
HTML translation. Making HTML into TeX We did this with the "WWW Book" to print it. See the Makefile [TeX/Makefile] for example, and the scripts
html2latex.sed [TeX/html2latex.sed] and sub1.sed [TeX/sub1.sed]. We wrote a special introduction, but otherwise all the text was hypertext from the W3
project. Generating HTML [HTMLGeneration/Overview.html] These are scripts for generating SGML hypertext from things like directory listings, etc.
Also, for checking and correcting dubious HTML. Server log analysis Analysing server logs requires first of all changing the numeric internet node
numebrs into domain names. httpd-analyse.c [LogAnalysis/httpd-analyse.c] is a program to do that. Feed the results through awk and grep of your
choice! _________________________________________________________________ Tim BL [http://info.cern.ch./hypertext/TBL_Disclaimer.html]
