ACME UPDATES

What's new at ACME Laboratories!


09Apr2020 Caption Maker improved: I added a bunch of improvements to the Caption Maker from a few days ago, including a popup color picker. Which is
itself available as a JavaScript widget.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/220.html]


02Apr2020 Caption Maker: Shelter-in-place boredom prompted me to write a little widget that creates simple text captions, styled as you like, which
you can then screencap and use. ACME Caption Maker

13Oct2019 Outgoing Email: Sonic did some config change a week ago that made my outgoing email stop working. That's ok, I was doing it the wrong way
anyway - I was trying to send mail directly, while Sonic wants customers to relay through their server for better spam protection. Fine. But [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/218.html]


01Oct2019 Internet Outage: ACME's Sonic fiber internet was down from 12:15am to 1am. When it came back, we had a new DHCP IP number, so that took a
while to propagate through DNS. Traffic got back to normal levels after about half a day.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/217.html]


17Apr2019 GeoRSS Date Picker: I added a date selection feature to my GeoRSS viewer. One problem with this idea is that standard GeoRSS does not
include a date in the items. However, regular old RSS does include a date, and GeoRSS is based on RSS, so I decided it was ok to use RSS's <pubDate>
[...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/216.html]


10mar2019 Unicode in JavaScript: I was doing some Unicode stuff in JavaScript today. I needed to extract the code points from a string. You might
think that the way to get the code point at a given position in a string is: cp = str.codePointAt( i ); Hah hah, no. That only works for points in
[...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/215.html]


26feb2019 ACME Mapper photos bugfix: Fixed a super annoying bug in Mapper's Flickr photos feature. The first time in each Mapper session that you
changed the number of photos, you would lose all your option settings! Now your settings are safe again.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/214.html]


20dec2018 Map Cursor Changes: I made a minor change in the mouse cursors on all ACME maps. Under Google Maps API, the mouse cursor is an arrow and
changes to a hand when dragging. In Leaflet, the cursor is the hand and when dragging changes to a pointing hand. I figured out how to make Leaflet's
[...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/213.html]


11nov2018 Brain Transplant: Acme's main server froze around 2am, and when I woke up it remained unresponsive. I had a spare motherboard on hand
because this model is known to die after a few years of uptime. I swapped in the new one and things seem to be fine now.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/212.html]


26oct2018 New version of mini_httpd: I stored out version 1.30 of mini_httpd. This includes an important security fix. Prior versions allowed remote
users to read arbitrary files in some circumstances. This version plugs the hole. I checked all my other web servers and they do not have the same
bug.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/211.html]


26sep2018 Geocoding: So after converting all my map pages from Google to Leaflet, I was still using Google for geocoding (converting addresses into
coordinates). The level of geocoding requests on my big map averaged just a little under Google's new $200/month free allowance, so I [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/210.html]


27aug2018 More Map Changes: Got an email from Mapbox this morning saying "Hi there, It looks like your Mapbox account has used 100% of the free
services included with your plan." Ok, not a big deal, I'm probably just barely over for the month. Checking... No, actually I went over the free
limit [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/209.html]


13aug2018 Converting *Your* Google Maps to Leaflet: If you have a Google Maps API page that is suddenly costing you real money, and you want to switch
to Leaflet like I did, here's how! First, go to the Leaflet.js page and bookmark it. You will be referencing it a lot. The Leaflet page has a section
called Tutorials, [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/208.html]


09aug2018 ACME Mapper Options Updated: I have finished updating Mapper's Options popup. Some things to note: The layers control can be set to be
always open, instead of opening on hover. Some folks have asked for this, and now they have it. The scale widget can be set to show meters/kilometers,
feet/miles, [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/207.html]


07aug2018 ACME Mapper Options Changing: I have been doing some work on the options system. It has mostly been behind the scenes with no user-visible
changes so far. However today's change means some of your saved options got reset to the default values. Don't panic, just set them back the way you
like [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/206.html]


04aug2018 Photo Markers: A long time ago, ACME Mapper could be used to display Flickr photos taken in the area shown. That capability broke when
Google switched their map API from version 2 to version 3, and I never got around to fixing it. Well I just got it working in the new Leaflet version.
[...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/205.html]


03aug2018 New Maps: I have finished converting all twenty-two ACME maps from Google Maps API to Leaflet.js. Let me know if you run into any problems.
To recap: on 15 July, Google raised prices on the Maps API by 14x, and lowered the free allowance by 30x. This means my cost for [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/204.html]


18jul2018 Maps: Google recently made some changes to their Maps API, which ACME uses on many pages. They switched from having a free level of service
to charging for everything but giving a $200/month credit. By itself that would be no big deal. However they also raised the effective [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/203.html]


29jun2018 FIBER!: ACME Labs is now on the net via gigabit fiber from Sonic. A thousand times the bandwidth for 1/5th the cost. Woo hoo! The install
happened a month earlier than I had scheduled, which is good. It also took 8.5 hours, which is not so good. But it works great now. Lots of [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/202.html]


27May2018 handle more HTTP methods: I have stored out new versions of thttpd, mini_httpd, http_get, and oauth_sign. The change is the same in all of
them: handle more HTTP methods besides the usual GET/HEAD/POST. This was necessary because of one new call in the Twitter API that requires HTTP
DELETE, for [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/201.html]


23apr2018 Flickr and SmugMug: Flickr was recently bought by SmugMug. Hurrah! Flickr is a photo sharing site that has been around since 2004. I've been
using it every day since a month after it launched, and love it dearly. It has gone through a lot of changes, getting bought by Yahoo!, [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/200.html]


04feb2018 new versions of thttpd/mini_httpd: I have released thttpd 2.28 and mini_httpd 1.28. They both include a fix to a buffer overrun bug in
htpasswd, reported by Alessio Santoru as CVE-2017-17663. If you are just using htpasswd to set up your own web auth files locally, there is no
security implication [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/199.html]


12Aug2017 Comments Weblet: I updated the ACME Comments Weblet to reasonably modern technology - JavaScript, CSS, and a JSON API. The old version,
written in 2005, used <iframe>s. Remember <iframe>s? I didn't!
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/198.html]


26nov2016 mini_httpd 1.26: This fixes a long-standing bug on FreeBSD using http but not https. Files were getting truncated at 1MB. This was due to
improper usage of sendfile(2), and not testing the http path since I only use mini_httpd for https. Since Linux has a completely different [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/197.html]


21Jun2016 Space War: Back in 2007 I wrote a version of the classic Space War game in JavaScript. It used sprites for graphics, which worked ok but was
complicated and inflexible. Since then, web browsers have gotten good support for HTML5 Canvas, a way to draw arbitrary graphics on [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/196.html]


11jun2016 Zoom5: Google's map API folks decided to get rid of the slider-style zoom control. I thought about re-implementing it, and actually made a
pretty good prototype, but then I had a different idea. How about in addition to the standard +/- buttons, an extra pair of +5/-5 [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/195.html]


10May2016 mini_httpd 1.24 released: New version of mini_httpd to fix an obvious and serious bug in binary POST request reading.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/194.html]


09Mar2016 DROWN: Stored out new versions of all my SSL-capable programs - mini_httpd, http_get, http_post, http_ping, xmlrpc - with SSLv2 disabled to
prevent the "DROWN" attack. SSLv3 had already been disabled in February 2015 to prevent the "POODLE" attack.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/193.html]


28Dec2015 mini_httpd 1.23 released: I made a new version of mini_httpd to fix CVE-2015-1548, a buffer overflow via snprintf.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/192.html]


20Oct2015 self-overlapping strcpy(): I recently got a bug report about mini_sendmail involving some string corruption. The reporter had done an
excellent job of tracking down the likely cause: using strcpy() on two strings that overlap. Turns out this is undefined. See the C89/ANSI C standard,
section [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/191.html]


16feb2015 Precedence Day: Merry Precedence Day!
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/190.html]


12feb2015 All The Milters: I updated all my "milter" mail filtering plugins for ACME's new OS: graymilter blackmilter sfcmilter spfmilter samplemilter
The changes include conforming to the current milter API, updating the FreeBSD rc.conf startup scripts to modern standards, and a new data structure
[...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/189.html]


06feb2015 new hardware: ACME is now running on new hardware, a nifty eight-core Atom C2750 machine that I built myself. There are still some glitches
to solve internally but external web and mail service seems to be working just fine. Here's a table showing the evolution of ACME's hardware: [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/188.html]


26jan2015 newmail: While setting up my new server (news on that soon), I noticed that I no longer had source for the "newmail" program. This was a
simple mailbox watcher that was included in the "elm" mail client from back in the 1980s. Rather than edit my .login to use a different [...]

16sep2014 Three Foot Passing Law: Some Q & A about California's new Three Foot Passing Law, CVC 21760, which goes into effect today, September 16th.
Q. Where is the three feet measured from? The centerline of the bicycle? A. It's from any part of the bicycle or rider to any part of the motor
vehicle. So [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/186.html]


14aug2014 More Clangification: I pushed out new versions of all but one of my C/C++ packages. A few more clang-related fixes and cleanup in every
package. The exception was pbmplus, I've still got a few minor fixes to make there.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/185.html]


24jul2014 Fixr: I've written a Flickr API app that includes a couple different fixes to inadequacies in Flickr. You can pick and choose which ones you
want to enable. Current offerings: Geotag Interoperation Standard geotags look like this: geotagged geo:lat=37.88185 geo:lon=-122.29556 [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/184.html]


19jul2014 ChuMaker Update: I took a break from clangification to do a little update to the ACME ChuMaker. Now the images are 60% larger.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/183.html]


16jul2014 Clangification: After three weeks or so I'm getting down to the short strokes on my clangification project. Out of an initial couple of
hundred packages I'm down to five. mini_httpd and thttpd - these are ready, but I still need to install them here and do some testing since [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/182.html]


25jun2014 FreeBSD 10.0: I am finishing off my first FreeBSD 10.0 install, on my new desktop machine. I thought I'd post some notes here. The hardware
is an HP Pavilion 23 "all in one". Nice big screen, four core CPU, 500GB disk. $500. The first problem I ran into was that it wouldn't boot [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/181.html]


24may2014 countdown: I added a new little program to the ACME freeware collection. It counts down a specified time interval. I use it mainly as an egg
timer. countdown
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/180.html]


13may2014 Overheated: We had a heat wave predicted for today. It didn't actually get that hot - except inside acme.com. I got home at 9pm and a
motherboard alert tone was going. Opened up the case and the problem was obvious - a wire had gotten caught in the CPU fan and stopped it. I moved
[...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/179.html]


22nov2013 New Map Versions: I have installed new versions of all the ACME maps. This was necessary because Google finally retired version 2 of their
Maps API, so I had to switch everything to version 3. I resisted switching as long as possible because version 3 seems much slower, but the time has
[...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/178.html]


26jun2012 Denial of Service: Some of you ACME fans may have noticed poor response times on the web site for a couple weeks. You were not imagining it,
and it wasn't just you. Acme.com was undergoing a denial of service attack. It started early in June and lasted two weeks, on and off. The [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/177.html]


01apr2012 Ok, ok.: Hah hah, April Fool. I'll turn the color back on now. Actually I needed to re-make all the photos anyway, because I increased the
size of the images from 576 pixels to 640 pixels. So I did it twice instead of once. Took over five hours each time!
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/176.html]


01apr2012 New image-processing algorithm: Flickr deploying the Atkinson Dither today got me interested in the subject of image-processing algorithms.
I read about another nifty technique called Floyd-Steinberg Error Diffusion, and immediately applied it to all my photographs. The results are
amazing! Check [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/175.html]


06feb2012 Welcome Back AdSense: Last week I blogged about how Google AdSense had cut me off, sending two form letters with no specifics. I appealed,
and they denied the appeal. I had no idea what was going on, and AdSense wasn't saying. People had a bunch of theories for why AdSense disabled me. My
site [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/174.html]


30jan2012 Goodbye AdSense: I have been using Google's AdSense web advertising system since it opened to the public, eight and a half years ago. Aside
from one quickly-resolved incident eight years ago, Google and I have been very happy with each other and have made a lot of money for each [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/173.html]


14dec2011 photo calendar: Each year I make a photo calendar for friends & family. The photo for each month was taken in that month the previous year
(well, I cheat on December). I haven't offered the calendar for sale before but it's easy enough to do so let's see what happens. $19.99 + [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/172.html]


10oct2011 xml2c: I wrote a little tool to convert XML files into static C structs. It's called xml2c.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/171.html]


02jul2010 oauth_sign: Twitter is turning off Basic Authentication soon, and switching to the OAuth three-party authorization protocol. I have a few
simple command-line twitter clients that I use when I'm on my antique H19 terminal instead of a pee cee, and those programs would stop working [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/170.html]


22jan2010 SecurePage: SecurePage is a little tool that lets you generate self-decrypting web pages. That is, you give it a regular HTML file and it
makes a new HTML file that is encrypted by a passphrase. If you have the passphrase then the file will decrypt itself back to the original [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/169.html]


29dec2009 New topo map tiles: I switched ACME Mapper's topo map mode from using Terraserver to using MyTopo.com. Service should be faster and more
reliable now.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/168.html]


30nov2009 Two Maps One Scale: I made a simple Google Maps app called Two Maps One Scale. It shows two locations at the same zoom level, so you can
visually compare sizes. See for example San Francisco and Paris.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/167.html]


25sep2009 Panoramio pix in ACME Mapper: And now ACME Mapper shows geotagged photos from Panoramio as well as from flickr.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/166.html]


23sep2009 flickr pix in ACME Mapper: I made a minor update to ACME Mapper, adding an option to show geotagged photos from flickr. To try it, first
click Options then click the flickr checkbox.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/165.html]


22apr2009 ChuMaker: Added a little toy I call the ChuMaker. It creates imitation Frank Chu protest signs.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/164.html]


09apr2009 Discussr: Ok, here's the app that I needed db for: Discussr. It's an alternate front-end for flickr's group discussions.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/163.html]


14mar2009 db: I'm working on a web app whose database is a little too big for tab-separated ASCII files but not big enough to merit a full-fleged SQL
database. It would be nice if there was a mid-range option, say a command-line interface to the dbopen(3) library routines. So I [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/162.html]


17feb2008 ACME Annotator: Another new AJAXy page: the Annotator. It lets you add notes to any image on the web.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/161.html]


22jan2008 ACME Chartmaker: The latest product from ACME Labs is a front-end for Google's graphing system which makes it much easier to use. Check it
out.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/160.html]


20jan2008 Power Failure: Unexplained power failure this evening. I don't know when it started, but it ended at 10:05pm, just 15 minutes after my UPS
ran down. "Ooo so close."
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/159.html]


02jun2007 Power Failure: Berkeley lost electricity for 2.5 hours due to someone's mylar graduation balloons hitting a power line. ACME stayed up.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/158.html]


14feb2007 googrep: I wrote a little program that combines Unix grep-style text searching with Google-style pattern syntax. It's called googrep.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/157.html]


12jun2006 Mapper Updates: I made two small upgrades to ACME Mapper: There's now a NEXRAD map type, showing weather radar. Geocoding is now done using
Google's service instead of Yahoo!'s, since Google has much wider coverage.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/156.html]


24may2006 Outage: We had a 9.5 hour power failure yesterday afternoon/evening. The UPS kept things going for 3 hours, so ACME was down for 6.5 hours.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/155.html]


16may2006 Outage: ACME's SDSL line was out from 3pm 15may to 11am 16may.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/154.html]


10apr2006 ACME Mapper 2.0: I have been working on a new version of my map page. The old one was an improved front-end for TerraServer. The new version
is based on the Google Maps API, so it has a much nicer user interface. Check it out: Mapper 2.0.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/153.html]


15feb2006 Hearts: As usual, Valentine's Day was busy for acme.com because of the Heartmaker - 1.2 million hits. In fact the only busier day I've had
was last June when my mail filtering tutorial got slashdotted for 1.6 million hits. Here's a graph of this week's traffic:
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/152.html]


12dec2005 micro_httpd: I stored out a new version of my tiny web server, micro_httpd. It has a better directory lister, and it now handles filenames
with spaces in them. This puts it over 200 lines of code, but that's still pretty small.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/151.html]


18nov2005 Golden Gate Sunsets map: For my first map based on the ACME GeoRSS Map Viewer, I plotted out all the spots from which you can see the sun
setting right in the middle of the Golden Gate.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/150.html]


12nov2005 ACME GeoRSS Map Viewer: I made a page that displays GeoRSS map files as a Google map. This lets people make nice pretty maps very easily.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/149.html]


12oct2005 Hot Springs: Yet another Google Maps app: USA Hot Springs. This one is a good example of how to present thousands of data points, way more
than the Google Maps API can normally support.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/148.html]


18sep2005 Planimeter: I remembered the name of the doohickey used to measure areas on a map, so I changed the name of the Areometer to the Planimeter.
Links using the old name will continue to work.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/147.html]


14sep2005 Areometer: Inspired by the Gmaps Pedometer, I made a map that computes the area enclosed by a given path: the Google Areometer. Actually
there already was at least one other map that does this, but it only does a planar approximation. My version uses completely accurate spherical [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/146.html]


18aug2005 Metro: I made a Google Maps version of the Paris Metro map. And it does route-finding! It's very slick.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/145.html]


29jul2005 BART: I made a Google Maps version of the BART schedule.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/144.html]


26jul2005 js_httpd: I wrote yet another tiny web server, but this one is in JavaScript. Why? People tend to think of JavaScript as a crippled Java,
but it's really more like awk on steroids, and not in the bad way that perl went. The version of the language I'm using for this has some [...]
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/143.html]


09jun2005 /.: The mail filtering pages got slashdotted yesterday. The server handled the load pretty well, except that there were a lot of packet
collisions on the two-foot ethernet segment between the server and the DSL box.

05jun2005 ipizer: First release of ipizer, a filter to improve sendmail log files so they are easier to analyze.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/141.html]


03jun2005 Outage: Had a two-hour power outage this evening. The server stayed up, on UPS. My workstation lasted less than an hour on its smaller UPS,
so I read a book while waiting.

25may2005 Filtering: The new ACME Labs Mail Filtering Tutorial is now open to the public.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/139.html]


18mar2005 Prints: I added an "Order Prints" button to all of my photos. This uploads the picture to smugmug if necessary, and then redirects you
there. You can also order stuff besides prints, such as t-shirts, coffee mugs, and jigsaw puzzles.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/138.html]


16mar2005 xmlrpc: I wrote a simple command-line XML-RPC client, xmlrpc.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/137.html]


11mar2005 Mapper: I added geocoding to the ACME Mapper. This means you can type in a street address and it will find the coordinates. It does this by
making an HTTP request to Google Local and parsing the results.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/136.html]


11feb2005 sfcmilter: I did some work on sfcmilter to make it a little less susceptible to false positives.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/135.html]


10feb2005 stat: Trivial new program available - stat. It displays info on a file, like "ls", but in programmer-level detail. I've actually had this
kicking around my personal src dir for years, but never got around to publishing it.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/134.html]


02feb2005 graymilter: New version of graymilter available - now it has an optional initial whitelist.
--Read More-- [http://acme.com/updates/archive/133.html]


24jan2005 Missile Defense: Found an amusing editorial cartoon on the net - ACME Missile Defense, by Bruce Plante from the Chattanooga Times Free Press
by way of Slate and 12thharmonic.

18jan2005 Outage: Another power outage this morning. The UPS battery lasted for three and a half hours! Too bad the outage lasted four hours. Oh well.

11jan2005 RSS: This page now has an RSS feed, by way of some trivial blogging shell scripts that I might release at some point. I also recently added
RSS to my photos page, using a more specialized set of scripts.
